# Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning with ResNet for Image Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to perform transfer learning and fine-tuning using the ResNet architecture for image classification. The notebook uses the PyTorch and TorchVision libraries and explores the process of reusing a pre-trained ResNet model on a new dataset with a different number of classes.

## Contents

- [Jupyter Notebook](transfer_learning_and_fine_tuning_resnet.ipynb): This Jupyter notebook guides you through the process of transfer learning and fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet model for image classification. It covers loading the model, preparing the dataset, defining loss functions, selecting appropriate layers for fine-tuning, and training.

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter notebook, you will need the following libraries and tools:

- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch
- TorchVision
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install these libraries using pip or conda.

```bash
pip install torch torchvision jupyter


```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transfer-learning-resnet.git
cd transfer-learning-resnet

```
